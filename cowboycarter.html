                    Yes, they are<br>
                    That Beyoncé Virgo shit<br>
                    In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand<br>
                    But in practice, well, some may feel confined<br>
                    I swear 'fore God, it's 'bout to hit it<br>
                    Jeeze, oh, ah<br>
                    Woop<br>
                    Right, right, ah, oh<br>

                    I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang (Goddamn) <br>
                    At the snap of my fingers, I'm Thanos, da-na, da-na <br>
                    And I'm still on your head, cornrows, da-na, da-na <br>
                    They call me the captain, the catwalk assassin (Come on) <br>
                    When they know it's slappin', then here come the yappin' <br>
                    All of this snitchin', and all of this bitchin' <br>
                    Just a fishin' expedition, dumb admission <br>
                    In the kitchen, cookin' up them chickens<br>
                    Extra leg, but I ain't even tryna kick it<br>
                    Cunty, country, petty, petty, petty<br>
                    All the same to me, Plain Jane, spaghetti<br>
                    No sauce, no sauce (No), too soft, too soft (Uh)<br>
                    They salty, they shootin', like Curry (One, two, three)<br>
                    One hand on my holster, then pass it to Hova<br>
                    Thought it was sweet when they was walkin'<br>
                    In the backdoor of the kitchen past the dirty dishes<br>
                    Now we on a mission, tried to turn me to the opposition<br>
                    I'm appalled 'bout the proposition<br>
                    Y'all been played by the plagiaristic, ain't gon' give no clout addiction my attention<br>

                    Outlaws with me, they gon' shoot <br>
                    Keep the code, break the rules (Break the rules)<br>
                    We gon' ride for every member that we lose<br>
